But this book is focused on a specific type of theory: the type that can be formalized as a computational model.\n\nWhat advantage does a computational (or mathematical) theory have over one that can't be expressed in computational terms? The biggest advantage is precision. For example, suppose you say that attention is like a spotlight ðŸ”¦: you can attend to things that are currently within the light, and you can control where the light is shining, but things outside of the light are outside of our awareness. This is a kind of theory -- an analogy-based one -- and it's a good start for making some general *qualitative* predictions about how attention works.\n\nBut you'll quickly run into problems if you want to make precise *quantitative* predictions about attention. How big is the spotlight? Does the size expand and contract? How quickly does it move around? Is attention completely absent outside of the spotlight or does it ramp down as you get near the edge of the light? In other words, if you wanted to build a computer model of this theory, a simple analogy doesn't cut it.\n\n*Computational models, if nothing else, force us to be explicit about all of our assumptions.*\n\n## Representations ðŸ”¸\n\nWe don't perceive the world as it truly is. As one example, the visible spectrum that our eyes can detect is just a fraction of the full electromagnetic spectrum. Similarly, we can only hear a narrow range of audible sound frequencies. In other words, we perceive an incomplete picture of the surrounding world.\n\n![Source: Abstruse Goose.](images/01/range_of_sensation.png)\n\nSimilarly, we are constantly making assumptions about the things we see and hear and using those assumptions to fill in gaps.\n\nWhat we have in our heads is a kind of model of the world around us -- what cognitive scientists call a mental representation. These representations help us to reach rapid conclusions about things involving language, causes and effects, concepts, mental states, and many other aspects of cognition.\n\nSome of the key questions for cognitive scientists who use computational models are:\n\n1.  What mental representations do we rely on?\n2.  How do our minds use these representations to learn when we get new information?\n3.  What kind of information do we get and how do our expectations about the kind of information we're getting to affect how we use it?\n\nThis book will elaborate, with examples, on each of these questions.\n\n## Homework 1: Build your first computational model ðŸ’»\n\n[![](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1MEiil0swXHERwJ38rVGZPTndyetHJPYQ?usp=sharing)\n\nTo get some initial experience with computational modeling, you'll build and experiment with a simple model of classical conditioning developed by Robert Rescorla and Allan Wagner -- now called the Rescorla-Wagner model.\n\nAll homework assignments for this book will be done in Google Colab.
