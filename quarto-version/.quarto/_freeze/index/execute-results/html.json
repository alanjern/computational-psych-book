It includes homework assignments written in Python.\n\n## Thanks {.unnumbered}\n\nThis book borrows inspiration and content (especially Chapters [2](#bayes) and [7](#pragmatics)) from Fausto Carcassi's [Introduction to Cognitive Modelling in R](https://thelogicalgrammar.github.io/cognitive-modelling-book/index.html) book and I am tremendously grateful to him for sharing his book publicly. Hopefully this resource will be equally helpful to others.\n\nA number of the modeling examples and homework assignments are adapted from code written by Danielle Navarro from previous iterations of her [Computational Cognitive Science course](https://compcogsci-3016.djnavarro.net/) with Andy Perfors. I am very grateful to both of them for making all of their materials public (and well documented).\n\nYour [feedback](mailto:jern@rose-hulman.edu) is welcome and encouraged.\n\n## License {.unnumbered}\n\n[![](images/badges/cc-by-nc.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)\n\nAnyone is free to reuse and adapt this book for their own non-commercial purposes, with attribution.
