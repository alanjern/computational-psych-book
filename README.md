# Computational Psychology in Python

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/comp--psych--book-v1.1-blue)

An online introductory textbook in cognitive modeling.

This book was originally developed in the Spring 2022 quarter for my Introduction to Computational Psychology course. The students were non-psychology majors with some background in programming and probability. The material is mostly an adaptation of my notes from a course that I've been teaching every two years.

The main goals for the course are:

* Introduce students to the basics of probabilistic/Bayesian cognitive modeling
* Show students the benefits of computational modeling for psychology over verbal theories (while acknowledging modeling's limitations)
* Expose students (at least in part) to the full process of computational cognitive science: developing theories, designing experiments, collecting data, building models, and comparing model predictions to human data
* Get students comfortable interpreting a description of a model in an academic paper and then implementing it on their own

Not all of these goals come across just in the book.
