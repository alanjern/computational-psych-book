## Thanks {.unnumbered}

This book borrows inspiration and content (especially Chapters [2](#bayes) and [7](#pragmatics)) from Fausto Carcassi's [Introduction to Cognitive Modelling in R](https://github.com/thelogicalgrammar/cognitive_modelling_book) book and I am tremendously grateful to him for sharing his book publicly. Hopefully this resource will be equally helpful to others.

A number of the modeling examples and homework assignments are adapted from code written by Danielle Navarro from previous iterations of her [Computational Cognitive Science course](https://compcogsci-3016.djnavarro.net/) with Andy Perfors. I am very grateful to both of them for making all of their materials public (and well documented).

Your [feedback](mailto:jern@rose-hulman.edu) is welcome and encouraged.
